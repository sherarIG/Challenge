# Challenge
 Challenge proposed by Company X

The solution of this Challenge is divided in folders. Each of the folders is a solution of an item in the Challenge:

 * **exercise_1**
 * **exercise_2** (with just a comment saying it is covered in exercise_1)
 * **exercise_3**
 * **exercise_4**
 * **exercise_5**
 
The corresponding documentation is under **docs** folder
 
Excercises 1 and 3 have their corresponding unit tests at **test_filter_json_exercise_1.py** and **test_filter_json_exercise_3.py**.
 
**test_consts_exercise_1.py** and **test_consts_exercise_3.py** are just constants used on the unit tests.
 
 
To have a working project in your local workstation you need to:
 
  1. Download the repository
  2. Inside the root destination folder, run the following command: **pip install -r requirements.txt**
