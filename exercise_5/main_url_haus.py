"""
This program will connect to an API from URLHAUS, download all the malware urls listed. It will create a dictionary
with those urls and finally with the data create:
- A json file
- A csv file
- An XML file
- An SQLite database (parameter), a table (parameter) and store the data in the mentioned table.
The dictionary structure is {id: , url:} where id is a unique incremental value.
The program uses two modules: sql_admin that handles the interactions with the database and file_admin that handles the creation of each of the files

PARAMETERS:
    db_name str : name for the database that the program will create
    table_name str : name for the table that the program will create inside the database
